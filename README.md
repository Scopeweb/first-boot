# First Day

This simple script installs all the software we use day-to-day, and prepares your laptop for the work you will do at Scope Web.

No Editors are included, because we find everyone has a personal preference.

## TODO

- Find way to install Microsoft Teams, LastPass, and Docker onto Linux with a script.

## Contributing

All PRs should be checked using ShellCheck to find bugs in the shell script and eliminate any error.
